ðŸ¦€ **Rust Learning Journey**

Welcome to my Rust Learning Journey â€” a personal log and code archive as I explore the world of systems programming with Rust. This repository will grow alongside my knowledge, from basic syntax to advanced topics like concurrency, web development, and systems architecture.

ðŸŒŸ **Why Rust?**

 - Memory safety without garbage collection
 - Zero-cost abstractions
 - Blazing-fast performance

---

ðŸ“š **Learning Goals (VPN-Oriented)**

 - Rust Fundamentals
  â†’ Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, pattern matching, error handling
 - Working with Files and I/O
  â†’ Reading/writing from devices, working with binary data
 - Socket Programming & Networking
  â†’ std::net, UDP/TCP, async networking with tokio, packet handling
 - Asynchronous Rust
  â†’ async/await, tokio, concurrency, runtime design
 - TLS/SSL & Encryption Basics
  â†’ Learn about OpenSSL, rustls, symmetric/asymmetric encryption, Diffie-Hellman
 - Cryptography in Rust
  â†’ Use crates like ring, aes-gcm, x25519-dalek, or rustls to implement secure channels
 - TUN/TAP Interfaces
  â†’ Interact with virtual network interfaces to route traffic through your VPN
 - Multi-threading and Parallelism
  â†’ Thread pools, channels, std::sync, shared state, tokio::sync
 - Process Management and Privileges
  â†’ Handling root permissions, capabilities, and sandboxing
 - Basic Network Protocols
  â†’ IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, NAT traversal
 - Logging and Observability
  â†’ Use tracing, log, and related crates to trace low-level activity
 - Building and Packaging
  â†’ Distribute cross-platform binaries, static linking, dockerization
 - Security Best Practices
  â†’ Memory safety, secure coding, threat modeling
 - Mini VPN Project (Capstone Goal)
  â†’ Build a basic VPN tunnel using TUN, encrypt packets, route traffic

🦀 Rust Learning Journey

Welcome to my Rust Learning Journey — a personal log and code archive as I explore the world of systems programming with Rust. This repository will grow alongside my knowledge, from basic syntax to advanced topics like concurrency, web development, and systems architecture.

🌟 Why Rust?

 - Memory safety without garbage collection
 - Zero-cost abstractions
 - Blazing-fast performance

📚 Learning Goals (VPN-Oriented)

✔️ Rust Fundamentals
→ Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, pattern matching, error handling
✔️ Working with Files and I/O
→ Reading/writing from devices, working with binary data
⬜ Socket Programming & Networking
→ std::net, UDP/TCP, async networking with tokio, packet handling
⬜ Asynchronous Rust
→ async/await, tokio, concurrency, runtime design
⬜ TLS/SSL & Encryption Basics
→ Learn about OpenSSL, rustls, symmetric/asymmetric encryption, Diffie-Hellman
⬜ Cryptography in Rust
→ Use crates like ring, aes-gcm, x25519-dalek, or rustls to implement secure channels
⬜ TUN/TAP Interfaces
→ Interact with virtual network interfaces to route traffic through your VPN
⬜ Multi-threading and Parallelism
→ Thread pools, channels, std::sync, shared state, tokio::sync
⬜ Process Management and Privileges
→ Handling root permissions, capabilities, and sandboxing
⬜ Basic Network Protocols
→ IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, NAT traversal
⬜ Logging and Observability
→ Use tracing, log, and related crates to trace low-level activity
⬜ Building and Packaging
→ Distribute cross-platform binaries, static linking, dockerization
⬜ Security Best Practices
→ Memory safety, secure coding, threat modeling
⬜ Mini VPN Project (Capstone Goal)
→ Build a basic VPN tunnel using TUN, encrypt packets, route traffic
